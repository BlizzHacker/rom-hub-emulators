"""The machine an emulator binary has to run on.

A target is not decoration. Every project in `projects.py` publishes one
release carrying builds for a dozen different machines at once -- mGBA
0.10.5 ships seventeen assets, of which two are Windows installers, one is
a 3DS homebrew build and two are debug symbols -- and the target is what
decides which single one of them an operator is offered.

**Never detected from the host OS.** `libretro-cores` makes the same
refusal for the same reason and it is worth repeating rather than
cross-referencing: the Hub is frequently not running on the machine that
will run these binaries. A Linux container serving a household's ROM
library while the emulator runs on a Windows desktop is the ordinary
deployment, not the exotic one. A plugin that read `platform.system()`
would install a `.AppImage` for somebody who needed a `.zip`, and the
symptom -- "nothing happens when I double-click it" -- surfaces long after
the decision that caused it.

So the target is config, and a target that is not in this table is refused
**by name**.

The names are spelled `os/arch` and are deliberately the same vocabulary
`libretro-cores` uses, so that an operator who has already configured one
of them does not have to learn a second spelling for the same machine.
`macos/universal` is the one addition: every macOS build in `projects.py`
is a single fat artifact rather than a per-architecture one, and inventing
`macos/x86_64` and `macos/arm64` that both resolve to the same file would
be two names for one thing.
